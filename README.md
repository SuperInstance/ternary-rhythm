## Overview

Temporal pattern recognition and generation using ternary time patterns.

Provides rhythm structures, metronomes, polyrhythms, syncopation detection,
groove analysis, and rhythmic evolution for ternary-valued temporal coordination.

## Architecture

- **`Rhythm`** — core data structure
- **`Metronome`** — core data structure
- **`Polyrhythm`** — core data structure
- **`Syncopation`** — core data structure
- **`Groove`** — core data structure
- **`RhythmEvolver`** — core data structure
- **`Ternary`** — state enumeration

### Key Functions

- `from_i8()`
- `to_i8()`
- `random()`
- `new()`
- `len()`
- `is_empty()`
- `tick()`
- `current()`
- `reset()`
- `density()`
- ... and 24 more

## Why Ternary?

The balanced ternary system {-1, 0, +1} (also known as Z₃) is the mathematically optimal discrete encoding:
- **More expressive than binary**: three states capture positive, neutral, and negative
- **Natural for decisions**: accept/reject/abstain, buy/hold/sell, agree/disagree/neutral
- **Self-balancing**: the 0 state acts as a universal screen, preventing pathological lock-in
- **Z₃ cyclic dynamics**: rock-paper-scissors is the only natural coordination mechanism

## Ecosystem

This crate is part of the **[SuperInstance Ternary Fleet](https://github.com/orgs/SuperInstance/repositories?q=ternary)**:

- **[ternary-core](https://github.com/SuperInstance/ternary-core)** — shared traits and Z₃ arithmetic
- **[ternary-grid](https://github.com/SuperInstance/ternary-grid)** — spatial grid with {-1, 0, +1} cells
- **[ternary-graph](https://github.com/SuperInstance/ternary-graph)** — ternary-weighted graph algorithms
- **[ternary-automata](https://github.com/SuperInstance/ternary-automata)** — three-state cellular automata
- **[ternary-compiler](https://github.com/SuperInstance/ternary-compiler)** — expression compiler and optimizer

200+ crates. 4,300+ tests. One pattern.

## Research Context

The ternary approach connects to several active research areas:
- **Ternary Neural Networks** (TNNs): weights constrained to {-1, 0, +1} for efficient inference
- **Huawei's ternary chip**: 7nm ternary silicon with 60% less power consumption
- **Active inference**: free energy minimization naturally maps to ternary action selection
- **Cyclic dominance**: RPS dynamics maintain biodiversity in spatial ecology
- **Z₃ group theory**: the only algebraic group on three elements is cyclic addition mod 3

## Usage

```toml
[dependencies]
ternary-rhythm = "0.1.0"
```

```rust
use ternary_rhythm;
```

## Migration

This crate uses `ternary_types::Ternary` (canonical) instead of its own `enum Ternary`.
